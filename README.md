# Preparing GNSS positional data for football tactical analysis

This repository contains a data sample of football small-sided games (SSG), as well as the referentail code for data processing prior to tactical analysis. To preserve anonymity, personal and location data that can determine individuals' information have been modified without affecting the demonstration purpose.


## Dataset A

An exemplar dataset of raw GNSS positional data from six individuals, each comprises columns of timestamp (Unix), and players' latitude and longitude coordinates during the SSG.


## Dataset B

An exemplar dataset of session details, provides the exact start and end timestamps of the SSG.

## Dataset C

An exemplar dataset of pitch location information, provides the geographic coordinates of four pitch corners.

## Codes

`preprocessing.py` provides all functions needed for data processing in `main.py`
